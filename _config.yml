# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  The contents of Whispers in the Fog are for informational purposes only—unless, of course, you’re already tangled in the city’s web of lies, in which case, welcome aboard. 
  Any resemblance to actual conspiracies, living or undead, is purely coincidental… or is it? Read at your own risk, because once you see the truth, there’s no unseeing it.
