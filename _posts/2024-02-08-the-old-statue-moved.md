title: The Old Statue Moved

There’s a statue in the park that’s been there for as long as I can remember. It’s old, weathered, and covered in moss. But yesterday, when I walked by, it was in a different spot. It wasn’t far—just a few feet from where it’s always been—but it had moved. 

No one else seems to have noticed, or if they did, they don’t care. But I care. I’ve walked past that statue every day for years. It doesn’t move. It *can’t* move. So how did it end up in a different spot?
