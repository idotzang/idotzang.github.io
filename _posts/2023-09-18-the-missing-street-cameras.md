title: The Missing Street Cameras

Three cameras went dark near the old park last night. Just for a few hours, but right around the time I saw something move—something too fast to be human. I was walking home when I noticed the flashing lights on the traffic signals at the intersection were all off. Odd, but not unheard of. Yet, when I looked up, the street cameras were blinking too. 

The strange part is, nothing else in the area seemed to be affected. Just those few blocks around the park. I’ve been noticing small blackouts more frequently. What’s going on, and who’s responsible? Are they testing something? Or is it a cover for something more sinister?
