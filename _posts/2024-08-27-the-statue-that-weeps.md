title: The Statue That Weeps

There’s an old statue near the courthouse, a marble angel with its head bowed. I’ve passed it a hundred times without giving it a second thought. But last night, I noticed something strange. The statue was weeping. 

At first, I thought it was just rain or condensation, but when I looked closer, I saw the tears—thick, red drops trickling down the angel’s face. I blinked, and they were gone. Was it just my imagination, or is there something more to that statue?
