title: The Old Man Who Knows

There’s an old man who sits on the bench near the market. He’s always there, watching people go by, but he never says much. Except for yesterday. Yesterday, as I walked by, he looked right at me and said, ‘It’s coming. Be ready.’ 

I stopped, but before I could ask him what he meant, he was gone. Just... disappeared. I haven’t seen him since. Who was he, and how did he know? More importantly, what’s coming?
