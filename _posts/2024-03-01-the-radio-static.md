Driving past the river last night, my radio started acting up. At first, it was just static, the usual interference you’d expect. But then, there was a voice. It was faint, but I could hear it through the static, trying to say something. I turned up the volume, but the signal was too weak to make out the words. 

What I heard though... it wasn’t a normal broadcast. It was... off, like the voice was echoing from somewhere far away. I haven’t been able to get that voice out of my head. What was it trying to say?
