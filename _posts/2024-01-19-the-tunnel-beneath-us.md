They say there are tunnels beneath the city—forgotten, abandoned tunnels that stretch for miles. Most people think it’s just a rumor, but I’ve seen one. Last night, I found an entrance. It was hidden behind a broken fence, leading down into the dark. 

I didn’t go in. Something about it felt wrong, like the air itself was warning me to stay away. But now I can’t stop thinking about it. What’s down there? Who—or what—uses those tunnels? I need to know, but I’m not sure I’m ready to find out.
