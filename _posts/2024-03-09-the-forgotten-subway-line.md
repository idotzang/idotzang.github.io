There’s an old subway line that hasn’t been in use for years, running beneath the city like a forgotten artery. Most people don’t even know it exists, but I’ve been doing some digging, and I found a way in. It wasn’t easy. The entrance is hidden, tucked away behind a pile of debris near the docks. 

I went down there last night, flashlight in hand. The air was thick with dust, the kind that clings to your skin and makes it hard to breathe. The tracks stretched out before me, disappearing into the darkness. I followed them for what felt like miles, but the deeper I went, the stranger things got. 

There were noises—clanging, hissing, like the echoes of a train long gone. But the tracks were silent, no sign of recent activity. Then, I found something—an old control panel, covered in grime but still functional. I don’t know how, but it lit up when I approached, like it was waiting for me. 

I pressed a few buttons, and that’s when I heard it—a train, rumbling in the distance. But it wasn’t coming from the direction I had just come from. It was deeper in the tunnels, moving toward me. I panicked and ran, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something—or someone—was watching. 

I barely made it out. The entrance sealed itself behind me, as if it had never been there. I’ve gone back since, but I can’t find the way in. The whole thing feels like a bad dream, but I know it was real. 

There’s something down there, something that’s been hidden for a long time. And it’s not just a forgotten subway line. It’s a gateway to something else.
