Last night, as I was walking down 10th Avenue, a car sped past me. It was going way too fast for such a narrow street, but when I turned to see where it went, it was gone. There was no intersection, no turn-off, just a straight road, but the car had vanished. 

I looked around, expecting to see tire tracks or hear the engine fading in the distance, but there was nothing. Just silence. Cars donâ€™t just disappear. So where did it go? And how?
