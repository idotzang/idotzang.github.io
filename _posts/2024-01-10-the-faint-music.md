Every night, right at midnight, I hear music. It’s faint, almost like it’s coming from far away. At first, I thought it was just the neighbors playing music too loudly, but when I asked them, they looked at me like I was crazy. 

It’s always the same tune, a haunting melody that drifts through the air. I’ve tried to find where it’s coming from, but no matter where I go, the sound is always just out of reach. It’s like it’s following me. I don’t know what’s worse—the music itself, or the fact that I’m the only one who hears it.
