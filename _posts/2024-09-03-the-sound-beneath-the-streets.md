title: The Sound Beneath the Streets

The city is full of noise—traffic, people, sirens. But lately, I’ve been hearing something different. It’s faint, like a hum, coming from beneath the streets. At first, I thought it was just the subway, but this sound is deeper, older. 

I’ve tried following it, but no matter where I go, it’s always just out of reach. It feels alive, like something is moving beneath the city, just below the surface. What’s down there? And why can’t anyone else hear it?
