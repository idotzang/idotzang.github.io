title: The Train That Never Arrived

Central Station, 10 p.m. I was waiting for the last train of the night. It was supposed to come right at 10:05. The station was packed with people, everyone ready to get home. But the train? It never showed up. No announcement, no delays—just silence. 

After an hour, people started leaving, but I stayed. I wanted to know what happened. Trains don’t just disappear, right? But last night, it did. And no one seems to care. I checked the schedule this morning, and that train? It was never listed.
