I first saw her two weeks ago. It was raining—one of those cold, miserable downpours that soaks you to the bone. She was standing under a streetlight, no umbrella, just staring at the ground. I almost walked past her, but something made me stop. There was something wrong about the way she stood there, completely still in the rain. 

I called out to her, but she didn’t respond. She just kept staring at the ground. I approached her slowly, not sure what to expect. As I got closer, I noticed her clothes were old—like something out of a different time. Her hair was soaked, plastered to her face, but she didn’t seem to care. 

When I was just a few feet away, she looked up at me. Her eyes were hollow, empty, like they’d seen too much. She didn’t say anything, just stared at me for a long moment before turning and walking away. I tried to follow her, but she disappeared into the rain, gone as quickly as she’d appeared. 

I’ve seen her twice since then, always in the rain, always standing under the same streetlight. She never says anything, never acknowledges me, but I know she’s aware of me. 

I’ve asked around, but no one else seems to have seen her. It’s like she’s some kind of ghost, tied to that streetlight, waiting for something—or someone. 

Next time I see her, I’m going to try to talk to her again. I need to know who she is, and why she’s always there in the rain.
