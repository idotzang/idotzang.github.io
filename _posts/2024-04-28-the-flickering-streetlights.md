The streetlights on Maple Street have been acting strange lately. They flicker on and off, but it’s not random. I’ve been watching, and there’s a pattern. They blink in a sequence, like they’re sending a message. 

I’ve tried recording the sequence, but every time I get close to cracking it, the lights return to normal, as if they know I’m watching. Someone, or something, is trying to communicate. But what are they trying to say?
