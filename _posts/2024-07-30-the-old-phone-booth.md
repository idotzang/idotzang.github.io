There’s an old phone booth near the park, one of the last ones left in the city. No one uses it anymore, not in the age of cell phones. But yesterday, as I passed by, it started ringing. I stopped, staring at it. No one was around. 

It rang again. I thought about picking it up, but something stopped me. I don’t know why, but the ringing felt wrong. Too loud, too insistent. I walked away, but the sound followed me down the street, like it was calling to me.
