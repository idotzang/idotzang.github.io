title: The Factory That Never Sleeps

There’s a factory on the outskirts of town that’s been running for as long as anyone can remember. No one really knows what they make there—just that it’s always active, day and night. The strange part? I’ve never seen anyone go in or out. No workers, no deliveries. Just smoke billowing from the chimneys, and the low hum of machines running inside. 

I’ve tried to ask around, but everyone seems tight-lipped about it. ‘Just leave it alone,’ they tell me. ‘It’s not your concern.’ But I can’t shake the feeling that something’s not right. How can a factory run for so long without anyone knowing what’s happening inside? 

Last week, I decided to get a closer look. I went at night, hoping to slip in unnoticed. The gates were unlocked, the place completely unguarded. I made my way to one of the side doors, and to my surprise, it was wide open. 

The moment I stepped inside, the air changed. It was thick with the smell of oil and something else—something metallic. The machines were running, but the factory was empty. No workers, no supervisors, just endless rows of machines, whirring and clanking away. 

I wandered deeper into the factory, but the further I went, the more unsettling it became. The machines weren’t just manufacturing—they were building something. Something big. I don’t know what it is yet, but it’s not something they want us to know about. 

I left before I could get caught, but I’m going back. I need to know what that factory is making—and why they’re keeping it a secret.
