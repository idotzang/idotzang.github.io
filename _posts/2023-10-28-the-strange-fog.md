Fog isn’t unusual around the waterfront, but this fog? This was different. It rolled in suddenly, thick and heavy, swallowing the streets in minutes. You couldn’t see five feet in front of you. But what got me wasn’t the fog itself—it was what I heard inside it. 

I was walking home when the fog came in. At first, it was just the usual mist, but then it thickened, and I started hearing noises. Footsteps. But no one was around. Then, breathing. Slow, heavy breathing, like something—or someone—was right behind me. I turned, but saw nothing. I’m not walking that way again anytime soon.
