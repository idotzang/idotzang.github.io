title: Symbols on the Walls

I keep seeing them—symbols etched into the walls of abandoned buildings. At first, I thought it was graffiti, but these markings are different. They’re precise, almost like hieroglyphs, carved into the brickwork like ancient scripts. The first time I saw one, it was near the docks, and since then, I’ve found more scattered throughout the city. 

People walk by them every day without noticing. But those who know what to look for? They’ll see the pattern. There’s an order to the chaos, and these symbols aren’t just random tags. They’re a message. But who is sending it, and what are they trying to tell us?
