I’ve lived in this building for years, and I thought I knew every inch of it. But last week, I found a door in the basement that I’d never noticed before. It was old and rusty, hidden behind a pile of junk. I don’t know why, but something told me not to open it. 

But now, I can’t stop thinking about it. What’s behind that door? Why was it hidden? I’ve been going back down there every day, just staring at it, debating whether I should open it or not. Part of me wants to know. The other part is afraid of what I might find.
