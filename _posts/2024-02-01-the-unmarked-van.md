I’ve seen it around before—a plain white van with no plates, parked in different parts of the city. At first, I thought it was just some utility vehicle, but now I’m not so sure. It never stays in one place for long, and I’ve started noticing a pattern. It only shows up after something strange happens—blackouts, missing persons, that kind of thing. 

The last time I saw it, I decided to follow it. I kept my distance, but the van seemed to know I was there. It led me through winding streets, deeper into parts of the city I’d never been to before. Then, without warning, it vanished. One moment it was there, the next it was gone, like it had slipped into some hidden part of the city. 

I’ve been trying to track it down again, but it hasn’t reappeared. It’s like the van comes and goes with purpose, always just out of reach. Who drives it? And why are they so careful not to be seen? It feels like they’re watching us, keeping tabs on what we know. 

There’s something off about that van, something dangerous. I’ve talked to a few other people who’ve seen it too, but none of them seem willing to dig deeper. It’s like they’re afraid of what they’ll find. But I can’t let this go. I need to know what’s inside that van—and who’s driving it.

If you see it, keep your distance. Don’t get too close. Whatever’s going on with that van, it’s tied to the bigger picture, I’m sure of it. I just need to find out how.
