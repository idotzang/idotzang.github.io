The old school on Elm Street has been closed for years. The windows are boarded up, the playground is overgrown, and no one goes near it anymore. But last night, I saw a light in one of the windows. Just for a second, a faint glow, like someone was inside. 

I tried to get closer, but the gate was locked, and I couldn’t see much beyond the overgrowth. I don’t know who—or what—was in there, but I’m going back tonight. Maybe I’ll get some answers.
