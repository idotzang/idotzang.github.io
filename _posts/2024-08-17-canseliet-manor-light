title: "What Was That at Canseliet Manor?"

It’s been a few months since I last wrote about **Canseliet Manor**, and things have been quiet—until last night. If you were anywhere near the manor, you probably saw it too. Around midnight, there was a strange burst of energy. It wasn’t just a flicker of lights—this was different. For a split second, the entire manor lit up, like someone had flipped a switch on a hidden generator.

But here’s the weird part: it wasn’t just light. Some folks nearby said they felt a strange *vibration*, almost like a low hum coming from deep underground. And that green light I mentioned months ago? It was there again, but this time it shot straight into the sky, like a beam.

No one’s saying a word about it. The workers that usually come in through the back gate showed up early this morning, acting like nothing happened, like they didn’t even notice. But how could they *not*?

It makes you wonder—what’s really going on inside Canseliet Manor? What could cause that kind of energy burst? And why is everyone pretending it didn’t happen?

I’ll be keeping an eye on this one, truth-seekers. Something’s brewing, and it’s only getting stranger.

Stay curious.
