There’s something unsettling about the bridge on West End. People say it’s haunted, but I never put much stock in those stories—until last night. I was walking home, crossing the bridge, when I saw them. Figures. Dark shapes, standing in the shadows. They didn’t move, didn’t make a sound, but I could feel their eyes on me. 

I hurried across, refusing to look back. But I can’t shake the feeling that something—or someone—was watching. People say it’s cursed, that those who linger too long on the bridge at night never make it home. I didn’t believe them. Now, I’m not so sure.
