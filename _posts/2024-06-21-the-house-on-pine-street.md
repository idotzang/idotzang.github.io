There’s a house on Pine Street that no one talks about. It’s old, crumbling, its windows boarded up, and its yard overgrown with weeds. But it wasn’t always like that. I remember when the Thompsons lived there, a nice family with two kids. Then, one day, they were just... gone. No one knows where they went. 

Since then, the house has sat empty. At least, that’s what everyone thought. But lately, I’ve been seeing lights inside, flickering at odd hours of the night. I’ve walked past it a few times, hoping to catch a glimpse of something—anything—that would explain what’s going on. But the curtains are always drawn, and the doors always locked. 

Two nights ago, I decided to get a closer look. I walked up to the front door, planning to knock, but as I reached for the doorknob, I heard voices—whispers, coming from inside. I couldn’t make out the words, but they were low, urgent, like someone was having an argument. 

I knocked, but no one answered. The whispers stopped immediately, leaving only silence. I backed away slowly, my heart pounding, and I haven’t gone back since. 

I asked a few neighbors about the house, but no one wanted to talk about it. They just shook their heads and told me to stay away. ‘That place is cursed,’ one of them said. 

I don’t believe in curses, but there’s something wrong with that house. Something that doesn’t want to be found. But I’m going back. I need to know what happened to the Thompsons—and what’s hiding inside that house now.
