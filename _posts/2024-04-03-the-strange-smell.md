There’s a smell downtown, something faint but disturbing. It comes and goes, like a rotting stench carried on the wind. I’ve walked past it multiple times, and each time, it’s in a different place. 

I can’t figure out where it’s coming from, but it’s not natural. It’s old, decayed, like something long dead has been disturbed. I haven’t seen anything, but the smell is always a warning. Something is near. And whatever it is, it’s not good.
