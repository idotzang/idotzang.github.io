title: Lights in the Old Warehouse

I was walking past the old warehouse on 3rd Avenue last night. The building has been abandoned for years, no signs of life or activity. But as I passed by, I saw lights flickering inside. At first, I thought it might just be a reflection or some kids messing around, but this was different. The lights seemed... purposeful. 

I went back this morning to check, but of course, everything was quiet. No lights, no movement, just the same old decaying building. But something was in there last night. I’m sure of it. Whatever it was, it’s hiding. For now.
