There’s a grove of old trees near the edge of the city. I’ve passed by them a dozen times, but last night something was different. As I walked by, I heard whispers. It was faint, like voices carried on the wind, but it was coming from the trees. 

I stopped to listen, and for a moment, it was like the trees themselves were speaking. The whispers grew louder, more frantic, but I couldn’t understand the words. I backed away slowly, and the moment I left the grove, the whispers stopped. But something is alive in those trees, something ancient.
