For the past week, I’ve had the feeling that someone’s watching me. I can’t explain it, but wherever I go, I feel eyes on me. I’ve checked, of course. I’ve looked around, tried to spot whoever—or whatever—it is. But there’s no one. 

It’s subtle at first, just a tingling at the back of your neck. But now, it’s constant. I see movement in my peripheral vision, but when I turn, there’s nothing there. I’m not paranoid. Someone’s out there. Watching.
