title: The Shadow on the Roof

I was coming home late, and I saw it—a shadow, moving along the roof of the old apartment building across the street. It was quick, darting between chimneys and antennae. But it wasn’t a person. It couldn’t have been. The way it moved... too fast, too fluid, like it was gliding. 

I watched it for as long as I could, but it disappeared behind the rooftop before I could get a better look. Whatever it was, it knew I was watching. And now, I feel like it’s watching me.
