There’s a playground near my apartment that’s usually full of kids during the day. But last night, as I walked past, it was deserted. Nothing strange about that—except for the fact that the swings were moving. 

There was no wind, no one around, but the swings were swaying back and forth, like someone had just pushed them. I stood there for a while, watching. It was eerie, but I couldn’t look away. Whatever was playing on those swings, it wasn’t human.
