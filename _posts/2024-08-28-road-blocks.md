title: "Roadblocks in Whitecliff: What Are They Hiding?"

If you've tried getting into **Whitecliff** lately, you’ve probably noticed the new **roadblocks** that have sprung up overnight. They’re saying it’s for “public safety,” but something feels off. No one’s being told *why* these blockades are there, or when they’re coming down.

Residents aren’t talking, either. It’s like Whitecliff has just fallen silent. The few people who’ve made it past the blockades say there’s a different vibe—strange patrols, fewer people on the streets. There’s even talk of some kind of group enforcing “order” inside. But again, no one’s offering any explanations.

Why the sudden lockdown? And what exactly are they keeping out—or keeping in?

Stay curious. There’s more to this than they’re letting on.
