I’ve been seeing them more often lately—shadows where there shouldn’t be shadows. They’re always just at the edge of my vision, flickering in and out of sight. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but now I’m not so sure. 

The thing is, when I turn to look, they’re gone. But I can feel them, watching, waiting. I don’t know what they want, but they’re there. And they’re getting closer.
