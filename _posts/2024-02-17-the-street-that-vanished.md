I could’ve sworn there was a street here. I’ve walked this way hundreds of times, and I know this neighborhood like the back of my hand. But today, the street was gone. 

I stood there, confused, trying to figure out what had changed. There was no sign of it—no street signs, no pavement, nothing. It was as if it had never existed. But I know it did. I’ve been down that street. I’m not losing my mind... am I?
