Something strange is going on at **Canseliet Manor**, and it’s not just the eerie look of the place. It’s the way no one seems to use the front gate anymore. Locals say they’ve never seen anyone walk in or out through the massive iron gates. Instead, everything happens at the back, where a smaller, almost hidden gate sits.

Deliveries get dropped off there, workers slip in through it, and even the rare visitor uses the back gate. The front? Completely untouched, almost like it’s sealed shut. What’s even stranger is that no one seems to question it. The neighborhood’s quiet about it, like they’re pretending it’s not even happening.

And then there’s the fog that always gathers at night—thicker around the manor than anywhere else, clinging to the back gate. People nearby have mentioned hearing odd noises, like faint clinking metal or whispering voices, but again, no one seems to want to investigate.

Why the secrecy? Why avoid the front gate? Whatever’s going on, it’s weird, and nobody’s talking about it.

Stay curious, folks. There’s more to this place than meets the eye.
