The clock tower on Main Street hasn’t worked in years. The hands have been stuck at twelve, and the bells haven’t rung in as long as I can remember. But last night, at midnight, the bells rang. 

I was walking home when I heard them—loud, echoing across the city. I looked up, expecting to see the hands moving, but they were still stuck at twelve. So who, or what, rang the bells?
