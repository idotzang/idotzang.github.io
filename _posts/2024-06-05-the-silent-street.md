Oak Street has always been a quiet neighborhood, but tonight, it was too quiet. No cars, no people, just... nothing. I walked down the street, and it felt like the whole world had paused. Even the air was still. 

I checked my watch, expecting it to show that time had stopped, but it hadnâ€™t. Everything was normal, except the street. It was like the street itself was holding its breath, waiting for something. But what?
