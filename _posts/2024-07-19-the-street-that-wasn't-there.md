title: The Street That Wasn't There

I’ve walked this route a hundred times, but yesterday something was different. The street that’s always been there? It was gone. Not blocked off, not under construction—just gone. The houses that lined the street, the shops, everything—vanished. 

I checked maps, asked around, but no one else seems to remember it. How can a street just disappear like that? It’s like it never existed, except I know it did. I’ve walked down it so many times... haven’t I?
