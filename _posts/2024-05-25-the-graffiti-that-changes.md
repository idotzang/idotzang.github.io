title: The Graffiti That Changes

There’s a wall near the docks covered in graffiti. But this isn’t just any graffiti—it changes. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. One day, it’s a picture of a skull, the next, it’s a cryptic message. I thought maybe someone was repainting it overnight, but the changes happen too quickly. 

I walked past it this morning, and the skull was back. I’m going to keep watching, but I’m not sure I want to know what it will show next.
