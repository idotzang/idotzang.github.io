title: The Sky Went Dark

It was just a few minutes, but it was enough to make me stop in my tracks. The sky went completely black. No stars, no moon, just... darkness. It was like the night itself had been swallowed up by something. People around me kept walking, not even looking up. 

I checked my phone, my watch—everything was working fine. But the sky? It was gone. And then, just as suddenly as it disappeared, it came back. I don’t know if anyone else noticed, but I sure did. What could block out the sky like that?
