title: The Silent Construction Site

There’s been a lot of construction in the city lately, but something about the new site on Elm Street feels... wrong. It’s quiet. Too quiet. Normally, these places are bustling with workers, machinery, and noise, but not this one. The site has been there for weeks, yet I haven’t seen a single person working. Just an empty site, sitting there, untouched. 

I’ve passed by at different times of day, trying to catch some movement, some sign of life. But it’s always the same—dead silence. What are they building? And why do I feel like whatever it is, it’s something we shouldn’t know about?
