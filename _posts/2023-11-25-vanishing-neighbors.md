It’s been happening more and more lately. People just... disappearing. Last week it was Mrs. Carr from 7th Street. She’s been my neighbor for years—always tending to her garden, saying hello as she walked by. But now? She’s gone. Her house is empty, and no one else seems to remember her. They look at me like I’m the crazy one when I ask about her. 

What’s happening to these people? How can someone just vanish without a trace, without a memory? I’ve started keeping track. Mrs. Carr isn’t the first, and I doubt she’ll be the last.
