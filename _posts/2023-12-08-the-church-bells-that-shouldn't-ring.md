title: The Church Bells That Shouldn't Ring

There’s an old church down on Elm Street that hasn’t been used in decades. The building is crumbling, and the bell tower has been silent for as long as I can remember. But last night, just after midnight, I heard the bells ring. Not once, not twice, but three times. It was loud and clear, echoing through the empty streets. 

I wasn’t the only one who heard it either. A few of my neighbors mentioned it this morning. But no one seems to know why or how it happened. There’s no power in that part of town, and no one’s been inside that church for years. So what, or who, rang those bells?
