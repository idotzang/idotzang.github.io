title: A Faint Glow in the Alley

Last night, a glow caught my eye in the alley behind 5th Street. It wasn’t a normal light—more like a pulse of energy, something alive. I stopped in my tracks, half expecting someone to appear from the shadows. But no one did. The light faded as quickly as it came, leaving the alley in complete darkness again. Yet, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. 

I went back today to check the alley in daylight. Nothing out of the ordinary—just old walls and garbage bins. But deep down, I know what I saw. The question is, what *was* it? A malfunctioning light? Or something else entirely? And why was I the only one to notice?
