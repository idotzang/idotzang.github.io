title: A Cold Wind on 9th Street

There’s a strange wind that blows through 9th Street, and it’s not just a regular gust of air. It’s cold—unnaturally so. Even in the middle of the day, when the sun is at its peak, you can feel it. It sends shivers down your spine, a reminder that something isn’t quite right in this part of town. 

I stood there yesterday, just to feel it again, to try and figure out where it’s coming from. But it’s not like a normal wind—it’s almost like it has a direction, a purpose. It’s been blowing through 9th Street for weeks now, but no one else seems to notice. They walk through it, oblivious. But not me.
